<h1 align=center>Python - Machine Learning Network Traffic Classifier</h1>

This project leverages multiple feature selection and extraction techniques combined with various 
machine learning models to classify network traffic data. The primary goal is to identify whether 
the network traffic is benign or an attack (e.g., DoS attack). 

The feature techniques include:

- SelectKBest
- Removing Constant Features
- Removing Near-Zero Variance Features
- LASSO Feature Selection
- Random Forest Feature Importance
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

The machine learning models used are:

- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
